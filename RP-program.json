    "Description":"DARPA launched the Revolutionizing Prosthetics program with a radical goal: Create an advanced electromechanical prosthetic upper limb with near-natural control that enhances independence and improves quality of life for amputees, and gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its use. In May 2014, less than eight years after the effort was launched, that dream is a reality; the FDA approved the DEKA Arm System.",
