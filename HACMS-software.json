"Description": "Bedrock is a library that turns Coq into a tool much like classical verification systems (e.g., ESC, Boogie), but niftier. In particular, Bedrock is: (1) Low-level: You can verify programs that, for performance reasons or otherwise, can't tolerate any abstraction beyond that associated with assembly language. (2) Foundational: The output of a Bedrock verification is a theorem whose statement depends only on the predicates you choose to use in the key specifications and on the operational semantics of a simple cross-platform machine language. That is, you don't need to trust that the verification framework is bug-free; rather, you need to trust the usual Coq proof-checker and the formalization of the machine language semantics. Higher-order: Bedrock facilitates quite pleasant reasoning about code pointers as data. (3) Computational: Many useful functions are specified most effectively by comparing with \"reference implementations\" in a pure functional language. Bedrock supports that model, backed by the full expressive power of Coq's usual programming language. (4) Structured: Bedrock is an extensible programming language: any client program may add new control flow constructs by providing their proof rules. For example, adding high-level syntax for your own calling convention or exception handling construct is relatively straightforward and does not require tweaking the core library code. (5) Mostly automated: Tactics automate verification condition generation (in a form inspired by separation logic) and most of the process of discharging those conditions. Many interesting programs can be verified with zero manual proof effort, in stark contrast to most Coq developments.",

The HACMS Decompiler enables a user to directly analyze and modify the resulting LLVM IR.  Near term additions to the HAMCS Decompiler include the ability to emit a C program representation from the IR. The HACMS Decompiler currently supports ARM architectures, however it will be extended to include X86, PowerPC, MIPS, and other ISAs as required by the program.",
