    "Description":"The Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) program aims to address the challenge of timely and robust security validation of mobile apps by first defining security properties to be measured against and then developing automated tools to perform the measuring. APAC draws heavily from the field of formal-methods program analysis (theorem proving, logic and machine proofing) to keep malicious code out of DoD Android-based application marketplaces. APAC seeks to apply recent research breakthroughs in this field in an attempt to scale DoD's program analysis capability to a level never before achieved with an automated solution.",
