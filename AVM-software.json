        "Description": "Model-based System Design, Analysis, and Verification Technologies:  The CyPhy tool suite (developed under the META program) made numerous advances in model-based system design with a focus on compressing the development lifecycle for complex defense systems. At the core of the tool suite is a generic modeling environment (GME) that can represent, transform, and integrate the numerous types of models and analysis used in the design and development of complex defense systems. This modeling environment enables the CyPhy tool suite to accomplish compositional design, trade space analysis and virtual performance testing in an extendable framework that can integrate tools ranging from robust commercial and open-source numerical simulations to cutting-edge research prototypes. CyPhy has been under evaluation since January 2013 through multiple design exercises. During these design events, teams worked to design drivetrain, suspension, propulsion, chassis, and structural elements and associated subsystems for an amphibious IFV. DARPA has built a Mobility and Chassis Automotive Test Rig (ATR), designed with the tools) in the iFAB Foundry to complete the 'end-to-end' design/develop/build/test process flow. Insights gleaned from this effort are being used to inform further CyPhy development efforts to integrate new design methodologies, consider more difficult physics domains, and validate virtual design, modeling, and simulation tools.",
