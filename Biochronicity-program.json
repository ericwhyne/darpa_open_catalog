    "Description":"Time is important to multiple biological processes, including circadian-regulated gene expression related to metabolic, cell cycle, and immune system functions. The overarching goals of BioChronicity are the integration of math, physics, and biology to: (1) understand time-dependent gene expression, (2) generate predictive models of complex biological systems, and (3) regulate molecular clocks to modulate clinical outcomes.",
