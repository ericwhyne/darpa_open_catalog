Comb-channel selection and weighting are used to enhance the peak in each subband summary correlogram. A subband reliability weighting scheme is used to combine the subband summary correlograms to obtain the MBSC, from which pitch and degree-of-voicing are determined. For more information, please refer to L. N. Tan, and A. Alwan, Multi-Band Summary Correlogram-based Pitch Detection for Noisy Speech, Speech Communication, Volume 55, Issue 78, September 2013, pp. 841-856. A reduced-complexity version is used by the SRI-SCENIC team, which uses a constant frame length, instead of multiple frame lengths, when computing comb-filtered outputs.",

These regions are identified without supervision: instead, cepstral and voicing features from short frames are clustered, and the program looks for a popular, narrow cluster with high energy. This is then considered the NT cluster, and used to produce NT region labels.",
