In Blaze, computations are described in a high-level language (Python) but executed on a low-level runtime (outside of Python), enabling the easy mapping of high-level expertise to data without sacrificing low-level performance. Blaze aims to bring Python and NumPy into the massively-multicore arena, allowing it to leverage many CPU and GPU cores across computers, virtual machines and cloud services. (Python)",

This project is about approach (b), and it's reached a state where it may be useful to others as a platform for research and experimentation. There are several optimization algorithms available with the baseline being sparse gradient descent (GD) on a loss function (several are available). The code should be easily usable.

Sketching reduces dimensionality through randomization, and includes Johnson-Lindenstrauss random projection (JL); a faster version of JL based on fast transform techniques; sparse techniques that can be applied in time proportional to the number of nonzero matrix entries; and methods for approximating kernel functions and Gram matrices arising in nonlinear statistical modeling problems. We have a library of such sketching techniques, built using MPI in C++ and callable from Python, and are applying the library to regression, low-rank approximation,   and kernel-based machine learning tasks, among other problems.

This interactive technique supports the ranking of items based on multiple heterogeneous attributes with different scales and semantics. It enables users to interactively combine attributes and flexibly refine parameters to explore the effect of changes in the attribute combination. This process can be employed to derive actionable insights as to which attributes of an item need to be modified in order for its rank to change. Additionally, through integration of slope graphs, LineUp can also be used to compare multiple alternative rankings on the same set of items, for example, over time or across different attribute combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-attribute visualization technique in a qualitative study. The study shows that users are able to successfully solve complex ranking tasks in a short period of time. (Java)",

Lyra also provides a data pipeline interface for iterative, visual specification of data transformations and layout algorithms. Visualizations created with Lyra are represented as specifications in Vega, a declarative visualization grammar that enables sharing and reuse. (JavaScript)",

A unique feature of WINGS is that its workflow representations incorporate semantic constraints about datasets and workflow components, and are used to create and validate workflows and to generate metadata for new data products. WINGS submits workflows to execution frameworks such as Pegasus and OODT to run workflows at large scale in distributed resources. (Java/JavaScript)",

At the back end is a distributed parallel computational environment such as Hadoop, that enables scaling to big data. In between are three Tessera packages: datadr, Trelliscope, and RHIPE (R and Hadoop Integrated Programming Environment). These packages enable the data analyst to communicate with the back end by simple R commands, and not have to worry about the details of distributed parallel computation. Tessera is powered by a statistical approach to large complex data, Divide and Recombine (D&R). The data are parallelized, not the thousands of methods, which makes back end computation typically very nearly embarrassingly parallel, and therefore very fast. But at the same time, D&R statistical division and recombination methods ensure good statistical performance.",

DeepDive is a trained system, which means that it uses machine-learning techniques to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and user feedback to improve the quality of its analysis. DeepDive can deal with noisy and imprecise data by producing calibrated probabilities for every assertion it makes. DeepDive offers a scalable, high-performance learning engine. (SQL, Python, C++)",

        "Description":"BlinkDB is a massively parallel, approximate query engine for running interactive SQL queries on large volumes of data. It allows users to trade-off query accuracy for response time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error bars. To achieve this, BlinkDB uses two key ideas: (1) An adaptive optimization framework that builds and maintains a set of multi-dimensional samples from original data over time, and (2) A dynamic sample selection strategy that selects an appropriately sized sample based on a query's accuracy and/or response time requirements. We have evaluated BlinkDB on the well-known TPC-H benchmarks, a real-world analytic workload derived from Conviva Inc. and are in the process of deploying it at Facebook Inc. (Scala)",

This offers an more intuitive storage, access and programming model for graph datasets while also ensuring performance optimized for efficient analysis over large graphs (millions-billions of vertices) and many instances of them (thousands-millions of graph instances).
