In Blaze, computations are described in a high-level language (Python) but executed on a low-level runtime (outside of Python), enabling the easy mapping of high-level expertise to data without sacrificing low-level performance. Blaze aims to bring Python and NumPy into the massively-multicore arena, allowing it to leverage many CPU and GPU cores across computers, virtual machines and cloud services.",

    "Description":"Information visualization rests on the idea that a meaningful relationship can be drawn between pixels and data. This is most often mediated by geometric entities (such as circles, squares and text) but always involves pixels eventually to display. In most systems, the pixels are tucked away under levels of abstraction in the rendering system. Abstract Rendering takes the opposite approach: expose the pixels and gain powerful pixel-level control. This pixel-level power is a complement to many existing visualization techniques. It is an elaboration on rendering, not an analytic or projection step, so it can be used as an epilogue to many existing techniques. In standard rendering, geometric objects are projected to an image and represented on that image's discrete pixels. The source space is an abstract canvas that contains logically continuous geometric primitives and the target space is an image that contains discrete colors. Abstract Rendering fits between these two states. It introduces a discretization of the data at the pixel-level, but not necessarily all the way to colors. This enables many pixel-level concerns to be efficiently and concisely captured.",

The implementation includes interfaces to CVX, CVXPY, matlab, as well as test routines.

D&R methods of division and recombination seek to make the statistical accuracy of recombinations as large as possible, ideally close to that of the hypothetical direct, all-data application of the methods. The D&R computational environment starts with RHIPE, a merger of R and Hadoop. RHIPE allows an analyst to carry out D&R analysis of big data wholly from within R, and use any of the thousands of methods available in R.
