        "Description": "The Cyber Fast Track program was a novel business process that allowed DARPA to legally do Cyber R&D contracting extremely fast and engage a novel performer base DARPA has not had access to. CFT contributed back to the performer base and became a valued (protected) resource. CFT was a technical effort that resulted in hundreds of completed novel cyber research efforts and provided immediate technical transition to Government partners. From August 2011 to April 2013, the program attracted 550 proposal submissions. 90% of these proposals are from innovative, non-traditional performers who have never done work with the Government. 135 Performer contracts were awarded. The average time for submission to award: 6 working days and the average Period of Performance was 5 months. ",
