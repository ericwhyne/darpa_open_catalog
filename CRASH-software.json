We have implemented Dune for Linux, using Intel's VT-x virtualization architecture to expose access to exceptions, virtual memory, privilege modes, and segmentation. By making these hardware mechanisms available at user-level, Dune creates opportunities to deploy novel systems without specialized kernel modifications. (C)",

The evolutionary computation represents candidate repairs as sequences of edits to software source code. Each candidate in a large population is applied to the original program to produce a new program, which is evaluated using test suites. Those candidates that pass more tests are said to have a higher fitness and are iteratively subjected to computational analogs of the biological processes of mutation and crossover. This process terminates when a candidate repair is found that retains all required functionality and fixes the bug. GenProg does not require special code annotations or formal specifications, and applies to unmodified legacy software. (C)",
